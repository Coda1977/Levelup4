"Being a manager is as easy as riding a bike. Except the bike is on fire, you're on fire, everything is on fire, and you're in hell."

That's one manager having a bad day. But they're not wrong.

**Management is not a promotion. It's a career change.**

The skills that made you a great individual contributor? They're now mostly irrelevant. The work you loved doing? You'll barely touch it. That technical expertise you spent years building? You'll watch others use it while you sit in meetings.

If you want to succeed as a manager, you need to understand one fundamental truth.

## Your Number One Role

**You are responsible for the work of your direct team.**

Not doing the work. Not hovering over the work. Being responsible for it getting done well through others.

You can be the smartest, most well-liked, hardworking manager ever. But if your team has a reputation for mediocre results, you're a mediocre manager. Period.

If someone on your team delivers poor work, you did a poor job developing them. If your team misses deadlines, that's your reputation getting damaged. Your team's output is your output.

## The Hack That Doesn't Work

New managers try to game this system by taking on all the important work themselves. "If I do the critical stuff, at least that will be good."

It's understandable. It's also unsustainable.

The whole point is to get work done through other people, not over them or around them. You can't scale yourself. You can only scale your team.

## Two Jobs, Not One

To achieve sustainable success through others, you need to master both sides:

**1. Make the work productive**
The "hard" stuff - creating goals and plans, rebuilding broken processes, inventing new tools, removing obstacles, clarifying priorities.

**2. Make the worker achieving**  
The "soft" stuff - giving clear direction, coaching through challenges, building confidence, providing feedback, understanding what motivates each person.

Skip either side and you fail. Focus only on process? Your team disengages. Focus only on people? Nothing ships.

Most managers pick the side they're comfortable with and ignore the other. That's why most managers struggle.

## The Calendar Test

Look at your calendar for next week. Count the hours you'll spend in meetings, 1:1s, reviews, and team discussions versus doing individual work.

If less than 60% of your time is spent on management activities (working through others), you're still playing individual contributor. You're riding that burning bike and wondering why everything around you is on fire.

## Try This Week

Pick your most important project—the one keeping you up at night.

Instead of diving in to "help," write down:
1. What does wild success look like? (Specific metrics, dates, outcomes)
2. Who on your team could own this and grow from it?
3. What would they need from you to succeed?
4. When will you check progress? (Not constantly—pick 25%, 50%, 75% markers)

Then delegate it. Completely. Not the easy parts while you keep the hard parts. All of it.

Yes, they might struggle. Yes, it might not be perfect. That's called learning.

In every conversation between a manager and an employee, someone sits in the Author seat and someone sits in the Editor seat.

Both seats must be filled. The question is: which one are you sitting in?

## The Two Seats

**The Author** does the actual work. They take ownership, show initiative, display critical thinking, and create solutions. They Author.

**The Editor** doesn't do the work. They set expectations for what they're looking for, and when the Author presents their work, the Editor makes it better. They Edit.

Here's how to spot the difference:

Your struggling employees want YOU in the Author seat. They come to you saying, "There's a problem. What should I do?" They want you to Author the solution so when things go wrong, they can say, "I just did what you told me."

Your best employees? They Author. They come saying, "Here's the problem, here are three options I'm considering, and here's my recommendation."

## The Trap

As a manager, if you're not requiring your direct reports to bring something for you to Edit, you're Authoring their work. You're not helping them improve their ability to think independently.

Every time you solve their problem instead of helping them solve it, you create dependency. They get weaker. You get busier. Everyone loses.

Think about it: When someone brings you a problem and you immediately start solving it, who's doing the thinking? Who's learning? Who's growing?

Not them.

## How to Stay in Editor Mode

**Never accept an empty page.** 

Employee: "We have a problem with the Johnson account."
You (Author mode): "Here's what we should do..."
You (Editor mode): "What are your thoughts on how to handle it?"

**Edit, don't rewrite.**

Even if their solution is 60% right, work with that 60%. Help them see what's missing. Ask questions that reveal gaps. Don't throw away their work and start over.

**Make them defend their thinking.**

"What other options did you consider?"
"What are the risks of this approach?"
"How would you handle it if X happened?"
"Why did you rule out Y?"

These questions build their judgment, not just their execution.

## The Dependency Test

Count how many times in your next team meeting you Author versus Edit.

If you're Authoring more than 20% of the time, you're training your team to bring you problems, not solutions. You're teaching them that thinking is your job, not theirs.

## Try This Week

Pick your most dependent team member—the one who constantly asks "What should I do?"

Next time they come with a problem, stop them:

"I need you to come back with three possible solutions and your recommendation. Think through the pros and cons of each. We'll meet tomorrow at 2pm to review your thinking."

They'll be uncomfortable. Good. They'll say they don't know enough. Don't cave.

"Use your best judgment with what you know. I'd rather review your imperfect solutions than create them from scratch."

Their first attempt will be rough. Their second will be better. By the third time, they'll stop needing you for everything.

That's the point. You're not building solutions. You're building problem-solvers.$CONTENT$, $PREVIEW$Discover the difference between Author and Editor roles, and learn how to develop independent problem-solvers on your team.$PREVIEW$, 2);

**Expectations are just resentments under construction.**

You expect people to "know" what good looks like because they've "been here long enough" or "it's common sense." Then you're shocked and angry when they miss the mark.

Every time you launch a new project without crystal-clear expectations, you're building future resentment. Theirs and yours.

## The Three-Part Clarity Conversation

Before any major project or responsibility, have this exact conversation:

**1. What's at stake?**
"Here's what this means for our customers/team/company, and why it matters now."

Don't assume they see the bigger picture. Paint it for them. When people understand the "why," they make better decisions about the "how."

**2. Why you?**
"I chose you for this because of your [specific skill/experience/perspective]."

This isn't flattery. It's clarity. When people know why they were chosen, they lean into those strengths. When they don't know, they wonder if they're just the only one available.

**3. What does success look like?**
"Here's precisely what needs to be delivered, by when, and how I'll measure success."

Vague: "Improve customer satisfaction"
Clear: "Reduce response time to under 2 hours for 90% of tickets by March 1st"

Skip any part of this conversation and you've set up failure.

## The Accountability Ladder

Watch where people operate on any given project:

**Perpetuating** - They make problems worse. They create drama, spread negativity, or actively sabotage.

**Observing** - They watch problems unfold from the sidelines. "Yeah, I saw that coming" but did nothing.

**Advising** - They tell others how to fix problems while staying safely uninvolved. All talk, no action.

**Solving** - They get into problems and fix them. They own outcomes, not just activities.

Most people hover between Observing and Advising. They see the fire, they might even point at it and describe it eloquently, but they don't grab the extinguisher.

## The Direct Conversation

When someone's not taking accountability, don't create elaborate systems or hope they'll figure it out. Have the conversation:

"On this project, I'm seeing you give advice about what should happen, but I need you to actually make it happen. When you see a problem, I need you to own it—not just flag it. Can you make that shift?"

Focus on the specific project, not their character. We all show different accountability levels depending on the work, the stakes, and our confidence.

## The Ownership Test

Ask yourself: If this project fails spectacularly, who would feel personally responsible? Who would lose sleep? Who would feel like they failed?

If the answer isn't the person running it, you haven't delegated accountability—just tasks.

Tasks without accountability is just creating busy work. Accountability without clarity is just creating anxiety.

## Try This Week

Take your most important project that's struggling. Have the three-part clarity conversation with whoever owns it:

1. Remind them what's at stake (make it real, make it matter)
2. Tell them specifically why you believe they can fix it
3. Get crystal clear about what success looks like by Friday

Then ask directly: "Are you ready to own this completely, or do we need to find someone who will?"

If they hesitate, dig deeper. What support do they need? What authority are they missing? What's making them reluctant to own it?

But don't let the conversation end without clear ownership. Shared accountability is no accountability.$CONTENT$, $PREVIEW$Master the art of creating clear expectations and true accountability without micromanaging.$PREVIEW$, 3);

Bill Walsh took over the worst team in the NFL—the 1979 San Francisco 49ers. They'd won 2 games the previous season. Total disaster.

Three years later, they won the Super Bowl. Then another. Then another.

How? Walsh ignored the scoreboard.

While other coaches obsessed over winning, Walsh obsessed over how his players carried themselves. How they practiced. How they dressed. How they spoke to media. Even how they sat on the plane.

He called it the "Standard of Performance"—the idea that champions don't focus on winning. They focus on the behaviors that predict winning.

## The Absolute vs. The Relative

Winning is relative. It depends on your opponent, the conditions, the referee, luck. You can play perfectly and lose. You can play terribly and win.

But a standard of performance is absolute. It's entirely in your control.

It's the difference between:
- "Beat our competitors" (depends on them)
- "Respond to leads within 2 hours" (depends only on you)

Walsh discovered something profound: **Quality outcomes are the natural byproduct of quality processes.**

Focus on the process, results follow. Focus only on results, both deteriorate.

## From Wishes to Standards

Most managers set "standards" like:
- Provide excellent customer service
- Show initiative  
- Be professional
- Communicate well

These aren't standards. They're wishes. Hopes. Prayers.

Real standards are observable and binary. You either did them or didn't.

## The Hotel That Gets It

A five-star hotel chain doesn't tell staff to "be friendly." They have specific standards:

**The 15-10-5 Rule:**
- At 15 feet: Focus your attention on any guest
- At 10 feet: Smile and make eye contact
- At 5 feet: Verbally greet them

Plus:
- Never tell a guest what you can't do—only what you can do
- Never let a guest do something for themselves that you could do for them  
- Treat anyone who walks in as a VIP

An average hotel hopes their staff will be friendly. This hotel has engineered friendliness into specific, repeatable actions.

Guess which one has better reviews?

## The Diet Principle

Want to lose weight? You could focus on the scale (outcome) or you could focus on behaviors (process):

- Don't consume white—flour, sugar, milk
- Eat as many vegetables as you want
- Stop eating at 8pm
- Use smaller plates

Do the behaviors consistently, weight loss follows. Obsess over the scale without changing behaviors, nothing happens except frustration.

Your team works the same way.

## Finding Your Standards

Study your highest performers. Not their results—their behaviors. What do they actually DO differently?

Your best salespeople might:
- Send follow-up emails within 2 hours
- Always include three options in proposals
- Call clients quarterly even without news

Your best engineers might:
- Comment code while writing it
- Test edge cases before being asked
- Document decisions in pull requests

These become your standards. Not "be a good salesperson" but "follow up within 2 hours."

## The Enforcement Reality

Walsh tracked everything. Jersey tucked in? Check. Arrived 10 minutes early? Check. 

His philosophy: If players couldn't meet small standards, they'd fail at big ones under pressure.

You don't need Walsh's military precision, but you need some tracking. Pick 3-5 behaviors that matter most. Make them visible. Celebrate when people nail them. Address immediately when they don't.

Standards without measurement are just suggestions.

## Try This Week

1. Pick one critical process for your team (client communication, code reviews, meeting management—whatever drives your success)

   - Not "good communication" but "respond within 4 hours"
   - Not "quality code" but "zero console errors, 80% test coverage"
   - Not "effective meetings" but "agenda sent 24 hours prior"

3. Share with your team: "This is what excellence looks like. Every time."

4. Track the behaviors for one week. Not outcomes—behaviors.

Don't track whether projects succeeded. Track whether people followed the standards. The success will follow.

**Are you a "know it all" or a "learn it all"?**

That's the question Satya Nadella asks Microsoft employees. It's also the question that predicts whether you and your team will adapt or become obsolete.

Know-it-alls believe talent is fixed. You're either good at something or you're not. They're the ones who say "I'm just not a numbers person" or "She's a natural presenter." When they fail, they quit. When they succeed, they coast.

Learn-it-alls believe talent comes through effort and new strategies. When they fail, they ask: "What can I try differently?" When they succeed, they ask: "What's next?"

Here's the thing: We all think we're learn-it-alls. But watch what happens when you struggle with something new. Do you push through and try different approaches? Or do you make excuses about how "that's not my strength"?

## The Myth of Effort

Everyone misunderstands growth mindset. They think it's about trying harder. That's dead wrong.

**Growth mindset = Effort + Learning = New Strategies**

Working harder at the same failing approach isn't growth mindset. It's insanity.

Think about kids playing soccer. The old way: medals for scoring goals. The new way: participation medals just for showing up. Both miss the point.

In a growth mindset world, you'd give medals for kids who learn new moves. The kid who couldn't kick with their left foot and now can. The kid who learned to pass backward to create space. The kid who figured out three ways to defend against faster opponents.

It's not about effort. It's not about results. It's about acquiring new strategies.

## The Fixed Mindset Trap

Listen to your team's language:
- "I'm just not good at presentations"
- "He's naturally talented at coding"
- "I've always done it this way"
- "Some people are just born leaders"
- "That's not really my thing"

This is fixed mindset. It's also Abraham Maslow's "aborted self-actualization"—deliberately planning to be less than you're capable of being.

Maslow put it brutally: "If you deliberately plan to be less than you are capable of being, then I warn you that you'll be deeply unhappy for the rest of your life. You will be evading your own capacities, your own possibilities."

Your team members are aborting their potential every time they say "I'm not good at that" instead of "I haven't learned that yet."

## Creating Growth Mindset in Your Team

**1. Mine the Learning from Mistakes**

Don't just say "it's a learning experience" and move on. That's empty. Use the simplest learning cycle:
- **What?** What actually happened? (Facts only, no interpretation)
- **So what?** Why did it happen that way? (Root cause, not blame)
- **Now what?** What will we do differently? (New strategy, not "try harder")

If you skip the "now what," you're just having a feelings circle, not learning.

**2. Replace Performance Reviews with Learning Reviews**

Instead of "How are the numbers?" ask "What new approaches have you tried this month?"

Instead of "You missed your target" say "Your current strategy isn't working. What are three different approaches you could test?"

Make learning the metric, not just results.

**3. Prep People for Hard Feedback**

Before giving criticism, say: "I'm about to share something that might sting, but it's because I see potential you're not using. Ready?"

This frames feedback as growth, not judgment. It's the difference between "You're bad at this" and "You haven't learned this yet."

**4. Celebrate Strategy Changes, Not Just Wins**

"I love that you tried building the presentation backward from the key decision. What made you think of that approach?"

"You completely changed how you run discovery calls. Walk me through what you learned."

When you celebrate new strategies, you get more of them. When you only celebrate results, you get people stuck doing the same thing harder.

## Try This Week

Find someone who's excellent at something you struggle with. Could be a peer, could be from another team, could be from YouTube.

Ask them (or observe): "What exactly do you DO that makes this work?"

Don't ask for tips or advice. Ask for their specific strategy—the actual steps they take, the exact words they use, the framework they follow.

Then try their approach exactly as they do it. Not your modified version. Their version.

That discomfort you feel copying someone else's approach? That's not embarrassment. That's learning. That's what growth mindset actually feels like.

**How many monkeys are on your back right now?**

Here's a typical five-second conversation:

Team Member: "Boss, we have a problem with the deployment."  
You: "Yeah, I heard. Let me look into it."

What just happened?

You adopted a monkey. That problem jumped from their back to yours in five seconds. The employee feels relieved. You feel responsible. The monkey is happy on its new back.

Each monkey takes 5-30 minutes to solve. If you have ten monkeys, that's five hours. If each of your five team members gives you two monkeys a week, that's a whole day gone.

Check your email, Slack, texts right now. Count the monkeys—the problems that started on someone else's desk and somehow became yours. 

## Getting Rid of Monkeys

These are the four steps to push a monkey back where it belongs:

**1. Describe the monkey**
Don't let the conversation end until you've identified specific next steps. What exactly needs to happen? By when? By whom?

**2. Assign the monkey**
The monkey belongs at the right level. Usually, that's not you. If your team member found the problem, they probably should own solving it.

**3. Insure the monkey**
Give them one of two insurance policies:
- **Recommend, then act:** They propose a solution, you approve, they execute
- **Act, then advise:** They solve it and tell you what they did

Pick based on risk and their experience. But pick one.

**4. Check on the monkey**
Schedule follow-ups at specific intervals. Not "keep me posted" but "let's review Friday at 2pm." Dead monkeys smell bad—you want to know before they die.

## From Partial to Full Delegation

Getting rid of monkeys is just partial delegation—pushing tasks back down. But you need full delegation—giving away entire responsibilities.

**Partial delegation:** "Create this report for me"  
**Full delegation:** "Own all customer reporting"

To figure out what to fully delegate, do this:

1. Write down everything you do. Everything. From the strategic to the mundane.

2. Sort into three buckets:
   - **Do:** Only you can do this (max 20-30%)
   - **Delete:** Adds no value, stop doing it
   - **Delegate:** Someone else could own this

3. If your "Do" list is over 30%, you're hoarding. If your "Delegate" list is empty, you're not developing anyone.

## The Delegation Conversation That Works

Most delegation fails because of unclear expectations. Here's the template that prevents that:

**1. Explain the full responsibility**
"You now own all customer success metrics and reporting."

**2. Define success clearly**
"Success means executives never call me asking what the numbers mean. They get what they need from your reports."

**3. Clarify your oversight level**

Break down the key activities and your monitoring:
- Budget planning: "I'll review quarterly" (low trust currently)
- Weekly reports: "You run them, I'll spot-check monthly" (medium trust)
- Team coordination: "You handle it, flag problems only" (high trust)

Be transparent: "I'm watching budget closely because it's new for you. My goal is to give you full autonomy within six months."

## The Trust Progression

Don't pretend you trust completely when you don't. That leads to micromanaging disguised as delegation.

Instead, be clear: "I trust your team coordination completely—you've done it successfully before. Budget planning is new, so we'll work closely on that at first."

This isn't insulting. It's honest. And it gives them a clear path to full autonomy.

## Try This Week

1. List three problems currently on your desk that started on someone else's

2. Pick the biggest one. Have this conversation with whoever should own it:
   - "This problem needs to be solved by Friday"
   - "Come back with three possible solutions and your recommendation"
   - "We'll review at [specific time], then you'll implement"
   - "I'm here if you hit a genuine roadblock, but try to solve it first"

3. For longer-term delegation, pick one recurring responsibility that takes you 30+ minutes weekly. Find someone who could learn it. Have the full delegation conversation using the template above.

Then actually let go. Don't secretly redo their work. Don't hover. Check at the agreed times only.

What really drives performance? McKinsey studied it. Google studied it. Microsoft obsessed over it.

Lindsay McGregor and Neel Doshi cracked the code in their research for "Primed to Perform." They found six motivators that predict both tactical performance (following process) and adaptive performance (solving new problems).

The first three boost performance. The last three kill it.

## The Performance Drivers

**Play**  
The work itself is enjoyable. Not ping-pong tables in the office—the actual work fascinates them. Developers who love elegant code. Salespeople who love the hunt. Designers who lose themselves in pixels.

**Purpose**  
They believe in the outcome. They see how their work matters. The nurse who sees patients heal. The teacher who sees students grow. The engineer whose code makes life easier for millions.

**Potential**  
The work helps them become who they want to be. It's a stepping stone to their bigger goals. The analyst learning skills for their startup. The manager building toward executive leadership.

These three predict both excellent execution and creative problem-solving.

## The Performance Killers

**Emotional Pressure**  
Fear, guilt, shame, or peer pressure drives them. They work to avoid disappointment, criticism, or letting people down. "I can't fail in front of everyone."

**Economic Pressure**  
They're only here for money or to avoid punishment. Work is purely transactional. "I do exactly what keeps my job, nothing more."

**Inertia**  
They work because... that's what they've always done. No active choice, just momentum. "I show up, time passes, I go home."

These three destroy creativity first, then engagement, then eventually basic execution.

## The Reality Check

You can't pay people enough to care. You can't scare them into innovation. You can't guilt them into going above and beyond.

But you can tap into what actually drives them.

The best companies have 2-3x more Play, Purpose, and Potential than average companies. The worst companies run on Emotional Pressure, Economic Pressure, and Inertia.

Which one is your team?

## The Stay Interview

Don't wait for exit interviews to learn what drives your best people. Do stay interviews now.

Schedule 30 minutes with a top performer and ask:

1. **"What are your top 4 reasons for staying?"**
Let them think. The real reasons often come third or fourth.

2. **"Who here makes work better for you?"**
This reveals relationship motivators you might not see.

3. **"Where do you see your work having impact?"**
This uncovers their sense of purpose—or lack of it.

4. **"If you could redesign your role, what would change?"**
This shows where potential is blocked.

5. **"If you managed yourself, what would you do differently?"**
This is where they tell you what they really need.

Then—and this is critical—actually do something with the answers. Otherwise you just accelerated their departure.

## Power Recognition

Every Thursday, ask yourself:

1. What great result did we achieve this week?
2. Who drove it?
3. What exactly did they do?

Then tell them. Not "great job"—tell them specifically:

"Your presentation landed the Johnson account because you anticipated their three biggest objections and addressed them before they asked. That preparation strategy is rare. Where else could you apply it?"

This isn't feel-good fluff. You're programming behavior. What gets recognized gets repeated.

The key is catching the strategy, not just the result. Results can be lucky. Strategies can be replicated.

## The Motivation Audit

For each team member, assess their primary drivers:

**High Play:** Give them interesting problems, not just urgent ones  
**High Purpose:** Connect their work to customer impact constantly  
**High Potential:** Show them the path to where they want to go  
**High Emotional Pressure:** Reduce fear, increase safety  
**High Economic Pressure:** Add meaning beyond the paycheck  
**High Inertia:** Shake things up, change their routine

You can't change people's core motivation overnight. But you can shift the mix gradually.

## Try This Week

**Part 1:** Pick your highest performer. Do the stay interview. Take notes on what really keeps them engaged. Find one way to give them more of that this month.

**Part 2:** Pick your most disengaged person. In your next 1:1, explore which performance killer dominates—emotional pressure (fear), economic pressure (just for money), or inertia (going through motions).

Don't try to motivate them harder. Instead, reduce the killer and add one driver. 

Example: If they're driven by fear (emotional pressure), create safety and add purpose by showing how their work impacts real people.

**The Kickstart Question: "What's on your mind?"**

Start here. Always. You'll be surprised what surfaces.

Follow with the AWE question: **"And what else?"** Keep asking until they've emptied their brain. The real issue often comes third or fourth.

**The Focus Question: "What's the real challenge here for you?"**

They'll describe ten problems. Make them pick one:

"If you had to pick one of these to focus on, which would be the real challenge for you?"

Notice the "for you" part. Not the biggest problem. Their biggest problem.

**The Foundation Question: "What do you want?"**

Before solving, clarify the goal. Often people are solving for the wrong target.

"What does a great outcome look like here?"
"What are you really trying to achieve?"
"If this worked perfectly, what would be different?"

**The Accountability Question: "How are you contributing to this problem?"**

This is the crucial shift—from coaching the problem to coaching the person.

Most people blame circumstances. This question forces them to find their power in the situation. If they can't see how they're contributing, they can't see how to solve it.

**The Action Question: "What are you going to do?"**

They'll start vague: "I need to communicate better."

Push for specific:
- "How specifically?"
- "What would that look like?"
- "What's the first step?"
- "Who do you need to talk to?"
- "When will you do it?"

Keep pushing until you have actions they can take today.

**The Lazy Question: "How can I help?"**

Ask this AFTER they've decided what to do, not before. Otherwise you're back to giving advice.

Make them be specific. Not "support me" but "review my email before I send it" or "introduce me to Sarah in Finance."

**The Learning Question: "What was most useful for you?"**

End every coaching conversation with this. It helps them identify the One Big Thing worth remembering. It also tells you what's actually helping versus what's just talk.

## The 70/30 Rule

They should talk 70% of the time. You talk 30%.

If you're talking more, you're teaching, not coaching. If you're solving their problem, you're consulting, not coaching.

Your job is to ask questions that help them think, not think for them.

## Why Questions Don't Work

Never ask "Why?" It puts people on defense.

- ❌ "Why did you do that?"
- ✅ "What were you hoping for?"

- ❌ "Why didn't you speak up?"
- ✅ "What stopped you from speaking up?"

- ❌ "Why is this important?"
- ✅ "What makes this important to you?"

"What" questions create exploration. "Why" questions create justification.

## The Advice Monster

You have an advice monster. We all do. It hears a problem and immediately wants to solve it.

The monster says:
- "I know exactly what you should do"
- "This reminds me of when I..."
- "Have you tried..."
- "What you need to do is..."

Your advice might even be good. That's not the point.

When you give advice, you rob them of learning. You keep them dependent. You become the bottleneck.

Coaching feels slower than telling. That's the point. You're building their brain, not just solving today's problem.

## Try This Week

Next time someone comes with a problem, use the full framework:

1. "What's on your mind?" (Let them download)
2. "What's the real challenge here for you?" (Focus on one thing)
3. "What do you want?" (Clarify the goal)
4. "How are you contributing to this?" (Find their power)
5. "What are you going to do?" (Get specific actions)
6. "How can I help?" (After they own it)
7. "What was most useful?" (Lock in learning)

Set a timer for 15 minutes. Don't give a single piece of advice. Just ask questions.

It will feel weird. You'll want to jump in with solutions. Don't.

Watch what happens when they solve their own problem. They'll leave energized instead of dependent. They'll execute better because it's their solution, not yours.

That's the paradox of coaching: By helping less, you help more.$CONTENT$, $PREVIEW$Learn the seven-question coaching framework that builds capability instead of dependency.$PREVIEW$, 3);

Great influence builds relationships and gets results. Bad influence might get immediate compliance but destroys trust over time.

Most influence tactics you've learned are manipulative garbage. These nine actually work because they connect, not control.

## 1. Start with CABI

Don't bury your request in a long backstory. Use CABI:

**Context:** The essential background (keep it brief)  
**Ask:** What you need from them  
**Because:** Why you need it  
**Input:** "What are your thoughts?"

Example: "We're presenting to the board Tuesday (Context). I need you to own the financial slides (Ask) because you understand the unit economics better than anyone (Because). What concerns do you have about that? (Input)"

This takes 30 seconds and sets up everything.

## 2. Don't Bury the Lead

A school sends this announcement: "Kenneth L. Peters, the principal of Beverly Hills High School, announced today that the entire high school faculty will travel to Sacramento next Thursday for a colloquium in new teaching methods. Among the speakers will be anthropologist Margaret Mead, college president Dr. Robert Maynard Hutchins, and California governor Edmund 'Pat' Brown."

What's the lead? **There's no school Thursday.**

Don't make people dig for your point. State it first, then add context if needed.

## 3. Push Their Hot Buttons

Everyone has triggers—things they move toward or away from. 

The universal hot button at work? Feeling valuable.

Don't know their specific button? Try: "I need someone who really gets [specific thing]. You're the only one I trust with this."

Watch their energy change.

## 4. Level 4 Listening

Most people operate at:
- **Level 1 (Avoidance):** "Uh huh" while checking phone
- **Level 2 (Defensive):** Listening to rebut
- **Level 3 (Problem-solving):** Listening for facts to fix things

You need **Level 4 (Connective):** Listening to understand the human.

Ask:
- "What does that mean for you?"
- "How do you feel about that?"
- "What was your first reaction?"
- "What's the hardest part for you?"

This isn't soft. It's finding out what actually drives them.

## 5. Prime Them

Assign them a trait before making your request:

"You're always so thorough with details... that's why I'd love your eyes on this proposal."

"I know how much you value straight talk... so I'm going to be direct."

This isn't manipulation if the trait is true. You're reminding them of their strengths then asking them to use those strengths.

## 6. Power Thank You

Three parts, every time:

1. **Thank them for the specific thing:** "Thanks for staying late on the Johnson proposal"
2. **Acknowledge the effort:** "I know you had dinner plans with your family"  
3. **Share the impact:** "Because of your work, we kept our biggest client"

Most people do step 1 and skip the rest. That's a regular thank you. Power comes from acknowledging cost and showing impact.

## 7. Take It All the Way to No

When they say no, don't fight or fold. Say:

"I either pushed too hard or missed something important to you, didn't I?"

They'll be shocked. Then they'll tell you exactly what you missed.

"You're right, I didn't consider the timing with your product launch."

Now you can actually address their real concern, not the surface objection.

## 8. Small Yeses

Build momentum with easy agreements before your big ask:

- "You'd agree our response time needs work, right?"
- "And faster responses would help retention?"
- "And dedicated ownership would speed things up?"
- "Great. Here's my proposal for dedicated customer success managers..."

Each yes makes the next yes easier. By the time you get to your request, they're already mentally aligned.

## 9. Three Options

Yes/no isn't two options—it's one binary choice. People need agency.

Always give three options:
- **The ideal:** What you really want
- **The acceptable:** What you can live with  
- **The minimum:** Better than nothing

"Ideally, you'd own the entire project. Alternatively, you could own just the technical side. At minimum, could you review our approach?"

This isn't settling. It's giving them control, which makes them more likely to choose the ideal.

## The Influence Paradox

The more you push, the more they resist. The more options you give, the more likely they'll help.

Great influence isn't about getting your way. It's about finding the way that works for both of you.

## Try This Week

Pick your toughest influence challenge—someone who usually says no to you.

1. Structure your request using CABI
2. Prime them with a genuine trait they value
3. Give them three options, not one demand
4. If they say no, take it all the way: "What did I miss?"

Don't use all nine tactics at once. That's overwhelming. Pick 2-3 that fit the situation.

Remember: Influence isn't about tricks. It's about making it easy for people to say yes by addressing what matters to them, not just what matters to you.$CONTENT$, $PREVIEW$Master the four-step feedback formula that actually changes behavior instead of making things worse.$PREVIEW$, 4);

In 1944, the OSS (predecessor to the CIA) created a classified field manual to teach spies how to sabotage enemy organizations.

Not with bombs. With meetings.

Here's their actual list for destroying an organization from within:

1. Insist on doing everything through "channels"
2. Make "speeches." Talk frequently and at great length
3. Refer all matters to committees for "further study"
4. Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible
5. Haggle over precise wordings of communications
6. Refer back to matters decided at the last meeting
7. Advocate "caution" and "reasonableness"
8. Be worried about the propriety of any decision

Sound familiar? Your meetings are being sabotaged by the same tactics that took down Nazi supply chains.

## The Smart Talk Trap

Bob Sutton and Jeffrey Pfeffer identified why in their Harvard Business Review article "The Smart Talk Trap":

"Smart talk has two components: first, it focuses on the negative, and second, it is unnecessarily complicated or abstract (or both). In other words, people engage in smart talk to spout criticisms and complexities. Unfortunately, such talk has an uncanny way of stopping action in its tracks."

Smart people love smart talk. It feels like progress. It's not.

## Situation Talk: Admiring the Problem

Groups can discuss the situation forever:

"Sales are down."
"Yes, and competition is increasing."
"Plus the economy is uncertain."
"And our product has issues."
"Don't forget about supply chain problems."
"It's even worse than we thought because..."

Hours pass. Nothing changes. You've collectively admired the problem.

Situation discussions describe what's happening:
- What we're doing
- What the market is doing
- What competitors are doing
- What the problems are
- Why it's difficult

Situation talk is risk-free. You're just stating facts. You might sound smart adding new facts, but there's no forward progress.

## The Shift: Situation to Outcome

When you catch situation talk, interrupt:

**"Let's stop talking about the situation. What outcome do we want?"**

Not what's wrong. What does "right" look like?

Example shift:
- Situation: "We don't have enough resources"
- Outcome: "We need to ship Feature X by March 1st"

Now you can actually solve something.

## Outcome vs. Next

Here's why outcome conversations work:

When you argue about what to do "next," everyone has opinions based on their experience, their fears, their department's needs. "Next" is personal and emotional.

But when you first agree on a future outcome, "next" becomes logical. If we want to be there, what steps get us there?

The outcome conversation reduces infinite possible actions to a few logical ones.

## The Exhausting Reality

Here's an actual meeting transcript (simplified but real):

**Ann:** "We can't fix all quality problems. Let's define specific outcomes."  
**Ben:** "Our two biggest customer complaints are UI bugs."  
**Chris:** "But that doesn't address Europe. Europe has different issues."  
**Ann:** "Okay, let's fix the top US issue and top three Europe issues by month-end."  
**Chris:** "But that doesn't solve our platform problems affecting pipeline by 20%."  
**Ann:** "What specific outcome would address that?"  
**Chris:** "We just need to fix it. It's really important."  
**Ann:** "That's still situation talk. How about: platform release in one year?"  
**Chris:** "But then we'll fall behind on features."  
**Ben:** "I'll work with sales to improve conversion on unaffected pipeline."  

Notice Chris. Every time Ann drives toward outcomes, Chris drags back to situations. This is sabotage—usually unconscious, driven by fear of commitment.

## The "Whole Problem" Trap

Someone always says: "But this doesn't solve the whole problem."

So what? 

Solve one concrete piece. Then another. Then another.

Perfect complete solutions are fantasy. Small concrete progress is reality.

## Describe What Working Looks Like

When stuck in situation talk, ask:

**"What would it look like if this was working?"**

Make them describe success:
- What would customers say?
- What metrics would change?
- What would the team be doing?
- What would stop happening?

Concrete outcomes drive action. Vague problems drive discussion.

## The Fear Behind the Talk

Why do smart people sabotage with smart talk?

Fear.

Once you define a specific outcome, you have to commit. You might fail. You might be wrong. You're accountable.

Situation talk feels safer. You can sound smart without risking anything.

But nothing changes. Nothing improves. Nothing ships.

## Try This Week

In your next meeting, track the split:

- How many minutes on situation (describing problems)?
- How many minutes on outcomes (defining success)?
- How many minutes on actions (deciding what to do)?

When situation talk exceeds 50%, interrupt:

"We've defined the problem well. What does success look like?"

Then enforce this progression:
1. Situation (briefly—under 50%)
2. Outcome (specifically—what success looks like)
3. Actions (concretely—who does what by when)

When someone tries to go backward ("But wait, let me explain more about the problem..."), redirect:

"We understand the situation. We're now defining outcomes. What does success look like?"

Be relentless. Every meeting should end with defined outcomes and assigned actions, not a deeper understanding of problems.

Stop admiring problems. Start defining success.$CONTENT$, $PREVIEW$Master nine influence techniques that connect rather than manipulate, building trust while getting results.$PREVIEW$, 1);

**30% of feedback makes performance worse.**

Not "doesn't help"—actively makes things worse.

That's from a meta-analysis of 607 studies on feedback effectiveness. Nearly one-third of the time, feedback decreases performance.

Why? Because most managers give garbage feedback like:
- "Be more assertive"
- "Show more initiative"
- "Improve your communication"
- "Be more strategic"

This isn't feedback. It's useless advice about personality change.

## The Four-Step Formula

Real feedback follows this exact structure:

**Step 1: The Action**

What did they actually DO? Be specific enough that a camera could have recorded it.

Bad: "You're not responsive to clients"  
Good: "Genesis emailed you Monday at 9am. You replied Wednesday at 4pm."

**Step 2: The Outcome**

What happened because of their action? This answers "why are we having this conversation?"

"Genesis is now threatening to cancel their contract. The CEO called me directly."

**Step 3: Alternative Actions**

Not what they should BE (personality) but what they should DO (behavior).

"Even if you don't have an answer, reply within 4 hours saying 'I got your email and will have an answer by [specific time].'"

**Step 4: Impact on Them**

Show how the change helps THEM, not just you or the company.

"Quick responses build trust. Trusted people get the interesting projects and autonomy. You hate being micromanaged—this is how you prevent it."

## A Complete Example

**Action:** "In yesterday's team meeting, when Sarah presented her idea, you immediately listed three reasons it wouldn't work."

**Outcome:** "Sarah stopped contributing. The team lost her perspective for the rest of the meeting."

**Alternative:** "Next time, ask 'What would need to be true for this to work?' before raising concerns."

**Impact:** "You want to be seen as strategic, not negative. Building on ideas before critiquing them shows strategic thinking."

## The Personality Trap

Never give feedback about who someone IS. Only about what they DO.

**Useless personality feedback:**
- "Be more confident"
- "Show leadership"
- "Be more strategic"
- "Be less aggressive"

**Useful behavioral feedback:**
- "Make eye contact with three people when presenting"
- "Run the client meeting yourself instead of deferring to me"
- "Connect your proposals to quarterly goals"
- "Lower your voice and slow down when disagreeing"

People can't change who they are. They can change what they do.

## The Timing Rule

Feedback has a half-life. Wait a week, lose 50% impact. Wait a month, might as well not bother.

But don't ambush. Schedule it:

"I want to discuss how the client meeting went. Can we talk this afternoon?"

This gives them time to prepare mentally and recall the situation.

## The Preparation Requirement

Never give feedback spontaneously. Write it out first:

1. What specific action? (Camera test)
2. What measurable outcome? (Numbers, relationships, results)
3. What alternative behavior? (Exact steps)
4. What personal benefit? (For them, not you)

If you can't fill all four, you're not ready. You're about to give garbage feedback that makes things worse.

## The Repeat Offender Protocol

**First conversation:** Focus on positive impact of changing  
**Second conversation:** Include negative impact of not changing  
**Third conversation:** This is now a performance issue, not feedback

If you're having the same feedback conversation three times, feedback isn't the tool you need.

## Try This Week

Think of feedback you've been avoiding. Write it out:

1. **The exact behavior** (what a camera would see)
2. **The business impact** (specific, measurable)
3. **The alternative action** (precisely what to do differently)
4. **Their personal win** (how it helps them, not you)

If you can't connect the change to their personal benefit, question whether you're asking for the right change.

Then have the conversation within 48 hours. Use your notes. Don't wing it.

Say exactly what they did, exactly what happened, exactly what to do differently, and exactly how it helps them.

That specificity is the difference between feedback that changes behavior and feedback that just annoys people.$CONTENT$, $PREVIEW$Learn to recognize and stop "situation talk" that kills productivity and progress in meetings.$PREVIEW$, 2);

Teresa Amabile from Harvard Business School wanted to know what really motivates people at work.

Not what they say motivates them in surveys. What actually motivates them day-to-day.

So she did something brilliant: She had 238 workers from 7 companies keep daily journals. At the end of each day, they recorded their best and worst moments. She collected nearly 12,000 daily entries.

One factor dominated everything else: **Progress on meaningful work.**

Not recognition. Not incentives. Not relationships. Not perks.

Progress.

The days when people made progress on work that mattered to them were their best days. The days when they were blocked, stalled, or spinning were their worst.

Stack up progress days, you get engagement. Stack up blocked days, you get resignation letters.

## The Progress Killer

Guess who's most likely to block your team's progress?

You.

Every delayed decision. Every "let me think about it." Every "wait for my approval." Every "let's discuss next week."

You're the bottleneck.

Your team is sitting idle, motivation draining, while they wait for you to unblock them. Meanwhile, you're in meetings talking about "engagement initiatives."

## The 1:1 Framework That Creates Progress

Stop treating 1:1s as status updates. Make them progress accelerators.

**1. Top Priorities and Blockers (10 minutes)**

"What are your 1-3 most important things this week?"
"What's blocking progress on any of them?"
"What do you need from me to unblock you RIGHT NOW?"

Not next week. Now. Either solve it in the meeting or commit to solving it within 24 hours.

**2. Calibrate Excellence (5 minutes)**

"Show me what you're producing."
"Here's what excellence looks like."
"Here's the gap between them."

Most performance problems are clarity problems. They think they're doing great. You think they're missing the mark. Nobody's talking about it.

**3. Real-Time Feedback (5 minutes)**

One thing they're doing well (specifically)
One thing to change (with clear alternative)
One thing you could do better for them

Don't save feedback for review time. Give it while it still matters.

**4. Zoom Out (10 minutes)**

"How are you feeling overall?"
"What's giving you energy?"
"What's draining you?"
"What do you want to learn next?"

This isn't therapy. It's data gathering. You're looking for trends that predict turnover or breakthroughs.

## The Progress Test

End every 1:1 with this question:

**"What progress will you make before we meet again?"**

If they can't answer clearly, you've wasted 30 minutes.

If they give the same answer week after week, something's blocking them that you're not addressing.

## The Energy Audit

Once monthly, map their energy:

"What percentage of your time is on work that energizes you?"
"What percentage drains you?"
"What would need to change to improve that ratio?"

Then actually shift their mix. Even 10% more energizing work changes everything.

People don't quit jobs. They quit the daily experience of their job. When every day is draining, they leave. When most days have progress and energy, they stay.

## The Calendar Reality

Look at next week's 1:1s. For each person, can you answer:
- What are they trying to accomplish?
- What's likely blocking them?
- What decision do they need from me?

If you can't answer these, cancel the 1:1 and find out first. Walking in blind wastes everyone's time.

## Try This Week

In your next 1:1:

1. Start with: "What's your biggest blocker?"
2. Solve it in the meeting or commit to solving within 24 hours
3. End with: "What progress will this unlock?"
4. Follow up in 48 hours: "Did you make the progress?"

Stop having conversations about work. Start removing barriers to work.

The best 1:1 isn't the one where you give great advice. It's the one where they leave able to make progress they couldn't make before.

**What are you getting paid for?**

To discuss? To review? To explore? To "align"?

No. You're paid to decide, define, agree, and commit. Those are outcomes. Everything else is expensive theater.

Most meetings are where productivity goes to die. But yours don't have to be.

## The 10 Behaviors That Create Great Meetings

**Behavior #1: Start with the Outcome**

Not: "Let's discuss the project"  
But: "By meeting end, we will decide: launch Friday or delay two weeks"

If you can't state a specific outcome, cancel the meeting.

**Behavior #2: Always Be Chairing (ABC)**

You can't zone out. You can't check email. You can't let your mind wander.

The moment you stop actively directing, the meeting drifts into chaos. Tangents multiply. Rabbit holes open. Time evaporates.

Participatory meetings are anarchy. Someone must drive. That's you.

**Behavior #3: Police Equal Participation**

Six people, one hour = 10 minutes each.

- One person dominating? Cut them off.
- Three people silent? Call on them.
- Two people arguing? Redirect to the group.

Intelligence of a group discussion equals the average speaking time equality. The more equal, the smarter the outcome.

**Behavior #4: 50% Action, 50% Situation**

Most meetings: 90% talking about problems, 10% solving them.

Set a timer. When half the meeting is gone, shift:

"We understand the situation. What are we going to DO?"

No going back to admire the problem more.

**Behavior #5: Move Through Steps Deliberately**

Every discussion follows this pattern:
1. What's the situation?
2. Is it good or bad?
3. Why is it happening?
4. What can we do?

Don't let people skip steps or jump backward. Move through each systematically.

"We're on step 3, understanding why. Let's finish that before we discuss solutions."

**Behavior #6: Never Go Backward**

Someone always tries: "But wait, are we sure this is even a problem?"

Unless they have new critical information: "We decided that. We're now on solutions."

Forward momentum only.

**Behavior #7: Recap Every 10 Minutes**

People's attention resets every 10 minutes. Use it:

"Here's where we are..."
"Here's what we've decided..."
"Here's what's next..."

This pulls wandering minds back and keeps everyone synchronized.

**Behavior #8: The Cut-Off Protocol**

When cutting someone off:
1. Summarize what they said
2. Acknowledge what it added
3. Explain why you're moving on
4. Park it if needed
5. Redirect to the path

"Great point about budget impact, that's important context. Let's note it and come back after we decide on timeline. Now, what are our options for delivery?"

**Behavior #9: Call Out Mode Switches**

Conversations shift between:
- **Depth:** One topic deeply
- **Breadth:** Many topics briefly

Call it: "We're going deep on this one issue for 5 minutes. Then we'll open up to other topics."

When people know the mode, they adjust their contributions.

**Behavior #10: End with Communication Brief**

Last 5 minutes, always:
- What did we decide?
- Who needs to know?
- Who tells them?
- By when?

No exceptions. A decision nobody knows about didn't happen.

## The Meeting Saboteurs

Remember that 1944 OSS manual? Watch for people who:
- Give long philosophical speeches
- Bring up last year's decisions
- Debate word choices endlessly
- Question already-made decisions
- Worry about unlikely edge cases
- Advocate "caution" constantly

Call them out: "That's interesting but not today's problem. Moving on."

Be polite but firm. Saboteurs rely on politeness to destroy productivity.

## The Energy Drain

Bad meetings don't just waste time. They drain energy, kill morale, and teach people that nothing gets done.

Good meetings do the opposite. They create energy, build momentum, and teach people that decisions happen here.

Which are yours?

## Try This Week

Run one meeting with all 10 behaviors:

Before the meeting:
- Write the specific outcome you need
- Identify who must be there (hint: fewer than you think)

During the meeting:
1. State outcome upfront (1 minute)
2. Stay actively in charge (constant)
3. Track participation time (mental note)
4. Force 50/50 situation/action split
5. Move through steps deliberately
6. Never go backward
7. Recap every 10 minutes
8. Cut people off productively
9. Call out depth vs. breadth
10. End with communication plan (5 minutes)

You'll feel like a dictator. Good. Meetings need dictators.

Democratic meetings are where productivity goes to die. Directed meetings are where decisions get made.

The best meeting isn't the one where everyone feels heard. It's the one that ends with clear decisions and assigned actions.
