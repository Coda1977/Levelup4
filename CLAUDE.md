  npm run test:coverage    # Coverage report (70% target)
  npm run test:ci          # CI-ready testing
  ```

## AI Chat Coach Feature ✅ [COMPLETE - Merged to Main]
- **Claude-powered Chat**: Management coaching with Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time word-by-word display like ChatGPT/Claude
- **Smart Context Selection**: Automatically selects up to 3 relevant chapters based on query
- **Conversation Management**: Create, continue, and delete conversations with persistence
- **Follow-up Suggestions**: Click-to-send contextual questions after each response
- **Local Storage**: Conversations persist without authentication
- **Mobile Responsive**: Full-featured chat with touch gestures and optimized layouts
- **Auto-naming**: Conversations automatically named based on first message

### Production-Ready Features ✅
**Core Functionality:**
- ✅ Streaming API with server-sent events for real-time responses
- ✅ Fallback to standard API if streaming fails
- ✅ Chapter content integration (up to 3000 chars per chapter)
- ✅ Local storage with UUID-based user sessions
- ✅ Mobile-responsive Claude-like split interface
- ✅ User/AI avatars for visual hierarchy
- ✅ Example questions for easy onboarding
- ✅ Persistent scroll position across conversations

**Technical Excellence:**
- ✅ DOMPurify integration for XSS protection
- ✅ Proper API key validation (no empty string fallback)
- ✅ Memory leak prevention in useEffect hooks
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Shared system prompt file for maintainability
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- ✅ Validation test suite (15/15 tests passing)

**UI/UX Polish:**
- ✅ Avatars distinguish user (initials) from AI messages
- ✅ Different background colors for AI messages (#f8f9fa)
- ✅ Smooth typing indicator during streaming
- ✅ Copy button for AI responses
- ✅ Responsive design with mobile hamburger menu
- ✅ "Try asking" suggestions in empty state
- ✅ Automatic scroll to latest message

### System Prompt Philosophy (200+ lines refined)
The AI coach is designed to be:
- **Direct**: "That's delegation failure" not "That sounds challenging"
- **Practical**: Every response includes something to DO tomorrow
- **Conversational**: Like talking to a smart colleague, not reading a manual
- **Confident**: Experienced coach who's seen this problem 100 times
- **Framework-smart**: Uses Level Up content when genuinely helpful, not forced

Key behaviors:
- Works with specific examples users provide (no "share an example" loops)
- Acknowledges emotions before jumping to solutions
- Admits when content doesn't exist and still provides help
- Matches user's tone (casual/formal) while staying direct
- Suggests questions users might ask next, not requests for more info

### Technical Architecture
```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── api/
│   │   └── chat/
│   │       ├── route.ts          # Standard API endpoint (fallback)
│   │       └── stream/route.ts   # Streaming SSE endpoint (primary)
│   └── chat/
│       ├── page.tsx              # Chat page wrapper
│       └── ChatClient.tsx        # Main chat UI component (678 lines)
├── lib/
│   ├── chat-storage.ts           # Local storage utilities
│   └── system-prompt.ts          # Shared AI prompt configuration
└── types/
    └── chat.ts                    # TypeScript interfaces

Key Design Decisions:
- Streaming-first with automatic fallback for reliability
- Local storage for privacy (no auth required)
- Shared system prompt for consistency
- Client-side chapter selection for performance
```

### Migration Notes for Future Auth
When implementing authentication, migrate local storage to database:
```javascript
// Current: localStorage (src/lib/chat-storage.ts)
LocalUserSession {
  userId: string (generated UUID)
  completedChapters: string[]
  conversations: Conversation[]
}

// Future: Supabase tables
users_table → userId, email, profile
conversations_table → id, user_id, title, created_at
messages_table → id, conversation_id, role, content, timestamp
user_progress_table → user_id, chapter_id, completed_at
```

## Still Need
- **User Authentication**: Login + progress tracking (integrate with chat)
- **Search**: Find chapters across categories
- **Dark Mode**: Theme switching
- **Learning Paths**: Guided chapter sequences
- **Analytics**: Usage metrics and insights

## Technical Notes
- **Development**: `npm run dev` on port 3001 (3000 in use)
- **Database**: Supabase with enhanced content schema
- **Caching**: 5-minute intelligent cache with automatic invalidation
- **Testing**: 90%+ coverage with comprehensive user flow testing
- **Status**: All critical bugs fixed, full test coverage, ready for new features
