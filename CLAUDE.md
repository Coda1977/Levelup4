  npm run test:ci          # CI-ready testing
  ```

## AI Chat Coach Feature ðŸŽ¯ [IN PROGRESS]
- **Claude-powered Chat**: Management coaching with Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **Smart Context Selection**: Automatically selects relevant chapters based on query
- **Conversation Management**: Create, continue, and delete conversations
- **Follow-up Suggestions**: Two contextual questions after each response
- **Local Storage**: Conversations persist without authentication
- **Mobile Responsive**: Full-featured chat on all devices
- **Auto-naming**: Conversations named based on first message

### Current Development Status (Branch: ai-chat)
**Working Features:**
- âœ… Basic chat functionality with Claude API
- âœ… Chapter content integration (up to 3000 chars per chapter)
- âœ… Local storage for conversations
- âœ… Mobile-responsive UI
- âœ… Follow-up question generation

**Recent Improvements:**
- Simplified system prompt from 50+ lines to ~15 for clarity
- Added emotional intelligence (recognizes frustration, provides acknowledgment)
- Fixed "share example" loop - AI now works with examples already provided
- Made conversation more natural, less framework-obsessed
- Improved follow-up questions to be specific, not generic

**Still Needs Work:**
- Sometimes forces frameworks when simple advice would be better
- Occasionally invents content not in chapters
- Follow-up questions could be more insightful
- Needs better handling of topics not covered in chapters
- Response consistency varies between conversations

### Chat Philosophy
The AI coach should feel like talking to an experienced manager who:
- Knows your content but isn't rigid about it
- Acknowledges emotions before jumping to solutions
- Works with specific examples users provide
- Admits when content doesn't exist and still helps
- Varies responses naturally (not templated)

### Migration Notes for Future Auth
When implementing authentication, migrate local storage to database:
```javascript
// Current: localStorage (src/lib/chat-storage.ts)
LocalUserSession {
  userId: string (generated)
  completedChapters: string[]
  conversations: Conversation[]
}

// Future: Supabase tables
users_table â†’ userId, email, profile
conversations_table â†’ id, user_id, title, created_at
messages_table â†’ id, conversation_id, role, content, timestamp
user_progress_table â†’ user_id, chapter_id, completed_at
```

## Still Need
- **User Authentication**: Login + progress tracking (integrate with chat)
- **Search**: Find chapters across categories
- **Dark Mode**: Theme switching
- **Learning Paths**: Guided chapter sequences
- **Analytics**: Usage metrics and insights

## Technical Notes
- **Development**: `npm run dev` on port 3001 (3000 in use)
- **Database**: Supabase with enhanced content schema
- **Caching**: 5-minute intelligent cache with automatic invalidation
- **Testing**: 90%+ coverage with comprehensive user flow testing
- **Status**: All critical bugs fixed, full test coverage, ready for new features
